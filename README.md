# JavaScript API Testing Project Sprint 7 

## Introduction

This project involves creating test cases in JavaScript using Jest. The goal is to verify the functionality of API requests. I have written and tested GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to ensure that each API endpoint behaves as expected, returning the correct results.

## Project Overview

- **Tasks**: Complete 5 tasks that involve making API requests and processing responses.
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for each type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure API endpoints function as expected.
- **Technologies**: JavaScript, Fetch API, Jest for testing.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies to begin working on the tasks.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
npm install
```

## Running Tests
To run the tests for your API requests, use the following command:

```bash
    npm test
```
